The goal of this challenge is to enhance my problem-solving skills, improve my understanding of various algorithms and data structures, and become a more proficient programmer.

## Challenge Overview

- **Duration**: 100 Days
- **Daily Goal**: Solve at least 3 coding questions per day
- **Technologies Used**:  I choosed to JavaScript 

## Daily Log

I will maintain a daily log of the questions I solve. This log will include the date, the questions solved, and links to the solutions.

Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”

**Q5** - Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 4, but this time store the famous person’s name in a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message. Print your message.


**Q6** - Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

...

### Day 3

**Date**: [2024-05-21]

Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.

**Q9** - Favorite Number: Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that message.

...

### Day 4

**Q14** - Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

**Q15** - Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite:

- Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.

- Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.

- Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.

**Q17** - Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests.
- Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.

- Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. Each time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.

- Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited.

- Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.

Call show_magicians() with each array to show that you have one array of the original names and one array with the Great added to each magician’s name.

**Q44** - Sandwiches: Write a function that accepts a array of items a person wants on a sandwich. The function should have one parameter that collects as many items as the function call provides, and it should print a summary of the sandwich that is being ordered. Call the function three times, using a different number of arguments each time.

**Q45** - Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name.
